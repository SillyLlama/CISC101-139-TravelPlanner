### **Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

# Change log
- 2025-11-28: Refined plan_builder.md based on AI critique — added proximity thresholds, budget enforcement, theme tags, weather backups, and conflict detection.

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:  
    pick Morning activity (near lodging)  
    pick Midday activity (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant or optional event
